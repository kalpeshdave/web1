== Synopsis

System Timer, a timer based on underlying SIGALRM system timers, is a
solution to Ruby processes which hang beyond the time limit when accessing
external resources. This is useful when timeout.rb, which relies on green
threads, does not work consistently.

== Usage

  require 'systemtimer'

  SystemTimer.timeout_after(5) do

    # Something that should be interrupted if it takes too much time...
    # ... even if blocked on a system call!

  end

== Requirements

SystemTimer only works on UNIX platforms (Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, BSD, ...).
You can install the gem on Microsoft Windows, but you will only get 
a convenience shell wrapping a simple call to timeout.rb under the cover.

== Install

    sudo gem install systemtimer

== Description

While deploying Rails application in production our team discovered
that some web service call would not timeout way beyond their defined
limit, progressively freezing our Mongrel cluster until we restarted
the servers. A closer analysis revealed that the native thread in charge of
of the web service call was never scheduled, "stucked" on the service
call. As it turn out the timeout library bundled with Ruby 1.8 (MRI)
relies on green-threads to perform its magic... so the magic had no chance
to happen in this scenario.

Based on an original idea by Kurtis Seebaldt <http://kseebaldt.blogspot.com>,
David Vollbracht and Philippe Hanrigou pair programmed an alternative
implementation based on system timers (the +SIGALRM+ POSIX signal):
This design guarantees proper timeout behavior even when crossing-boundaries and accessing
system/external resources. Special care has been taken to interfere as little as
possible with other processes that might also rely on +SIGALRM+, 
in particular MySQL.

This implementation is not intended to be drop-in replacement to
timeout.rb, just a way to wrap sensitive call to system resources.
