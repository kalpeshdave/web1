============= Ubuntu 8.10 Installation Instructions ===================

Below are quick installation instructions for Webiva on Ubuntu 8.10. If you have corrections or instructions for other Languages / Linux Distributions or Operating systems, please send them to webiva@cykod.com. 


First of all update your system to the latest packages:

$ sudo apt-get update

Now install all the necessary supporting software. You'll need git to
download the software. Also, webiva needs: Ruby, MySql, RMagick, memcached, rubygems 
and rake to run  (You'll also probably want Apache2 instead of running via webrick)
and you'll need to compile some gems to make it work so you'll need some dev 
libraries as well:

$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client ruby1.8 ruby1.8-dev rdoc1.8 \
    libmagick9-dev libimage-size-ruby1.8  libxslt1-dev \
    g++ gcc  libmysql-ruby1.8 irb openssl zip unzip libopenssl-ruby \
    apache2 memcached libmysqlclient15-dev build-essential \
    git-core rubygems rake


Starling (the background-process-queue) currently needs to be installed 
separately, it can be via a:

$ sudo gem install starling

Next clone the Webiva repository:

$ git clone git://github.com/cykod/Webiva.git
$ cd Webiva/

Next make sure memcached has started (It wasn't started correctly after install
on my test systems):

$ sudo /etc/init.d/memcached restart

Now run the quick install script to set up the master database and the 
first domain database:

$ ./script/quick_install.rb

You should then be able to run the webbrick server and access you website from 
port 3000:

$ ./script/server

(You may need to edit your hosts file so that you can pull up iniital website that you created)

Then start up the background processes:

$ ./script/background.rb start

======== Apache2 / Passenger Install ================

First get passenger installed:

(See http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#_operating_system_specific_instructions_and_information for more instormation )

$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.brightbox.net hardy main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brightbox.list'
$ sudo sh -c 'wget -q -O - http://apt.brightbox.net/release.asc | apt-key add -'
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-passenger

Easiest way to install webiva is to install it as the default virtual host
This way you can add domains and won't need to modify your apache2 configuration 
every time you add on a domain.

Create a virtual host like the one below (make sure the document root points 
to the webiva/public directory)

$ vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default

Either modify or replace with:

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName mywebiva.com
  ServerAlias www.mywebiva.com
  DocumentRoot /path/to/your/webiva/public/directory

#  PassengerDefaultUser user # Optional - set site to run as a specific user
#  RailsEnv production # Optional - set to production or development as necessary

# We don't want any user uploaded scripts to be executed in the public directory
<Directory "path/to/your/webiva/public/directory">
      Options FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride Limit
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
      <IfModule mod_php5.c>
        php_admin_flag engine off
      </IfModule>
      AddType text/plain .html .htm .shtml .php .php3 .phtml .phtm .pl
</Directory>

</VirtualHost>

Then start up the background server process

$ ./script/background.rb start

Finally restart apache and you should be good to go:

$ sudo apache2ctl restart

Bring up a browser and confirm that you can access your site.
